-------------------------------------------------------------Ruby Programming Language-----------------------------------------------------------


1. Ruby 
	:  A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. 
	   It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. 
	   Ruby is a pure object-oriented programming language. It was created in 1993 by Yukihiro Matsumoto of Japan.
	   Ruby has features that are similar to Smalltalk are scripting languages. Smalltalk is a true object-oriented language.
	   
	   
	   
2. Features of Ruby
	:  Ruby is an open-source and is freely available on the Web
           Ruby is a true object-oriented programming language.
           Ruby can be used to write Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts.
           Ruby is a server-side scripting language similar to Python and PERL.
           Ruby has a clean and easy syntax that allows a new developer to learn very quickly and easily.
           Ruby support many GUI tools such as Tcl/Tk, GTK, and OpenGL.
           Ruby can easily be connected to DB2, MySQL, Oracle, and Sybase.
	

3. Ruby Installation - Ubuntu
	URL:- https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/20.04
	
	commands: 
		.sudo apt install curl
		.curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
		.curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
		.echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
		.sudo apt-get update
		.sudo apt-get install git-core zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 
		  libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev software-properties-common libffi-dev nodejs yarn
		.sudo apt-get install libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev automake libtool bison libffi-dev
		.gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 
		409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB

		.source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
		.rvm install 3.0.2
		.rvm use 3.0.2 --default
		
		
4. How check version in ruby
	Ex: ruby -v
	    ruby 3.0.2p107 (2021-07-07 revision 0db68f0233) [x86_64-linux]

5. Methods used


	-> puts:  This method is used to display some message to the user.
		(Puts automatically adds a new line at the end of your message every time you use it.)
		Ex: puts "Hello there!"
	-> gets:  This method is used to take input from the user.
	-> .to_i: this method returns the integer conversion of the given string.
	-> print : If you donâ€™t want a newline, then use print.
		Ex: print 123	
	
6. comments
	-> Single-Line Comments
	 Ex:  # This line is ignored by the Ruby interpreter
	 
	->  Multi-Line Comments 
	Ex:   =begin   
		any number of lines may be written.
	      =end 
		
		
7. Interactive Ruby (IRb)
	-> Check version
		Ex: irb -v
		    irb 1.3.5 (2021-04-03)
	
	-> Ex: irb
		3.0.2 :001 > num=123;
		 => 123 
		3.0.2 :002 > def sayhi
		3.0.2 :003 >   puts "  hello "
		3.0.2 :004 > end
		 => :sayhi 
		3.0.2 :005 > sayhi
		  hello 
		 => nil 
		3.0.2 :006 > exit
		

8. All ruby files will have extension .rb.
	Ex:  ruby test.rb

		
9. Reserved Words
	: BEGIN 	do 		next 	 	then
	  END 		else 		nil 		true
	 alias 	elsif 		not 		undef
	 and 	  	end 		or 		unless
	begin 		ensure 	redo 		until
	break 	 	false 		rescue  	when
	case 		for 		retry 		while
	class 		if 		return 	while
	def 		in 		self 		__FILE__
	defined? 	module 	super 		__LINE__
		
		
		
		
10. Ruby Begin statement
	Syntax:
		BEGIN {
			code
		} 		
		
		Ex: puts "This is main Ruby Program"
			BEGIN {
			   puts "Initializing Ruby Program"
			}
			
		Output : 
			Initializing Ruby Program  
			This is main Ruby Program
		
		
11. Ruby END statement
	Ex: puts "This is main Ruby Program"
		END {
		   puts "Terminating Ruby Program"
		}
		BEGIN {
		   puts "Initializing Ruby Program"
		}		
		
		Output:
			Initializing Ruby Program
			This is main Ruby Program
			Terminating Ruby Program

		
12. Class in Ruby
	Ex: Class Vehicle {
	   Number no_of_wheels
	   Number horsepower
	   Characters type_of_tank
	   Number Capacity
	   Function speeding {
	   }
	   
	   Function driving {
	   }
	   
	   Function halting {
	   }
	}	

13. Variables in a Ruby Class
	Ex: Local Variables     (Local variables begin with a lowercase letter or _.)
	    Instance Variables  ( by the at sign (@) )
	    Class Variables     ( by the sign @@ )
	    Global Variables    (by the dollar sign ($).)



	-> Creating Objects in Ruby using new Method
	
		cust1 = Customer. new
		cust2 = Customer. new
		
		
	-> Custom Method to Create Ruby Objects
	
		class Customer
		   @@no_of_customers = 0
		   def initialize(id, name, addr)
		      @cust_id = id
		      @cust_name = name
		      @cust_addr = addr
		   end
		end


	-> Ex: Code Example_class(How to create and call)
	
		class Sample
		   def hello
		      puts "Hello Ruby!"
		   end
		end

		# Now using above class to create objects
		object = Sample. new
		object.hello
